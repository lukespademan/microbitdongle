What is microbitdonlge?
-----------------------
Micrbitdonlge is a simple way of interfacing with a micro:bit over serial with python.

Why use it?
------------
The micro:bit was made to help teach children (or anyone) to code.
Conneting your micro:bit to another device such as a raspeberry pi or laptop gives the micro:bit so much more potential.
Most people who are just learning to code don't understand serial.
Learning how serial works, and installing pyserial can be complicated for new programmers.

Using microbitdongle allows anyone to connect their micro:bit to their raspberry pi, pc or laptop just just a few lines of code without having to worry about serial ports etc.
